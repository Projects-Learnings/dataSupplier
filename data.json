      "author": "Jamal Washington",
      "body": "As AI becomes increasingly prevalent in our daily lives, tech companies are grappling with complex ethical questions. Facebook (now Meta) has established an AI ethics board to address concerns about data privacy and algorithmic bias. Apple, known for its stance on user privacy, is developing AI models that can function on-device, minimizing data transfer and potential breaches.\n\nHowever, critics argue that self-regulation is not enough. There's a growing call for government oversight and international standards to ensure AI development remains beneficial to society as a whole."
